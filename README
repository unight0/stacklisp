# Stacklisp

## What is this?
This is a simple pet project. It is supposed to
1. Translate lisp code into stackmachine code
2. Run stackmachine code
3. (optional) Compile stackmachine code

## How to use?
This is not yet finished. Only t1 (translation stage) has been more-or-less finished.

```
./t1 <file> # Translates into stackmachine code, outputs in readable format
```
